It&amp;rsquo;s going to offer wired and wireless Internet connections plus a bunch of other things you may not want and probably won&amp;rsquo;t need. Unfortunately, one of the things it&amp;rsquo;s going to offer you is poor performance. The wireless network on it probably won&amp;rsquo;t cover your whole house, and if you&amp;rsquo;re also limited in where you can hook it up that could mean poor coverage in the most important areas.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 21:03:44 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/about/</guid><description>I am a Canadian software developer and GNU/Linux system administrator currently employed as a Security Engineer with a strong track record of securing systems I administer. In addition to my strong background in GNU/Linux and Information Security, I am also familiar with OpenBSD and macOS.
In all areas of my work, I have a strong preference for working according to established standards and best practices. As a software developer, this means standards-based and accessible code and output with security built in and testing done before release.</description></item><item><title>Contact Me</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/contact/</guid><description>In general, I can be reached via email, although you may find other methods more appropriate depending on your purpose.
