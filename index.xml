In addition to my strong background in GNU/Linux and Information Security, I am also familiar with OpenBSD and macOS.
In all areas of my work, I have a strong preference for working according to established standards and best practices. As a software developer, this means standards-based and accessible code and output with security built in and testing done before release.</description></item><item><title>Contact Me</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/contact/</guid><description>In general, I can be reached via email, although you may find other methods more appropriate depending on your purpose.
