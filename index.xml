It&amp;rsquo;s really quite simple. Here we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how TCP flags (the original six plus ECE and CWR) map to a conversation between two people.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to start talking to someone. In TCP, you start with the three-way handshake:
You --- SYN --&amp;gt; Them You &amp;lt;--SYN/ACK--- Them You --- ACK --&amp;gt; Them In human terms, a SYN (synchronize) expresses that you&amp;rsquo;re asking to begin a conversation, and an ACK (acknowledge) is how you acknowledge what the other person has said.</description></item><item><title>SSH Certificates</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/12/07/ssh-certificates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/12/07/ssh-certificates/</guid><description>If you have a SSH server, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard that you should be using SSH key authentication instead of passwords. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of benefits to key authentication: better experience, smooth login, ability to log in via scripts, service accounts become possible, and keys are significantly harder to crack than a password. But if you deal with a lot of servers, or you manage a lot of users, or both, there&amp;rsquo;s a better way using SSH certificates instead of simple keys.</description></item><item><title>OpenBSD IPv6 Home Internet Gateway with Xfinity/Comcast</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/06/08/openbsd-ipv6-home-internet-gateway-with-xfinity/comcast/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/06/08/openbsd-ipv6-home-internet-gateway-with-xfinity/comcast/</guid><description>When you sign up for Internet service, one thing you&amp;rsquo;re going to get is a home gateway. It&amp;rsquo;s going to offer wired and wireless Internet connections plus a bunch of other things you may not want and probably won&amp;rsquo;t need. Unfortunately, one of the things it&amp;rsquo;s going to offer you is poor performance. The wireless network on it probably won&amp;rsquo;t cover your whole house, and if you&amp;rsquo;re also limited in where you can hook it up that could mean poor coverage in the most important areas.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 21:03:44 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/about/</guid><description>I am an InfoSec generalist, software developer, and system administrator for CentOS and OpenBSD servers.
