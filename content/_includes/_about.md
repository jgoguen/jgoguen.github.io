I am an InfoSec generalist, software developer, and system administrator for
CentOS and OpenBSD servers. I have a strong track record of effectively applying
established standards and best practices to my work. I take pride in delivering
high-quality results and consistently improving both back-end infrastructure and
the end-user experience.

I live in the United States where I'm employed as a Security Engineer with Meta.

As a software developer, I am familiar with shell scripting, Python 3, and
Golang. I can also work with C, Java, or Perl, and I can learn new languages as
needed. Having a strong information security background allows me to identify
potential security vulnerabilities and help teams solve the overall security
issues they face in a consistent and reusable way.

Having a strong generalist background in both system administation and
information security helps to keep systems I manage updated with security
patches and configured to be hardened against common security issues. I am also
able to more easily work with subject-matter experts to develop plans that both
enchance security and the end-user experience.
