In general, I can be reached [via email][email], although you may find other
methods more appropriate depending on your purpose.

If you're contacting me about career opportunities,
[my r&eacute;sum&eacute;][cvpdf] is available as a PDF download or you may
review [my LinkedIn profile][linkedin]. Please note that I am not currently
seeking new employment opportunities, nor am I considering changing jobs, and
I am only considering remote opportunities in Georgia, USA.

If you're contacting me about an open-source project I'm involved with, please
consider whether another avenue is more appropriate. If you have a bug report
or a feature request, please follow the standard procedure for whatever project
you're interested in and file a bug report or feature request. If you want to
discuss something about the project, please consider the public forums
available instead. Email is almost always not the best option, since few people
benefit from private email and many people benefit from public discussions.
However, I do recognize that different people have different circumstances, so
please send an email if you have something not appropriate for public
discussion.

For anything else, please [email me][email]. Please note, I do not wish to
receive unsolicited commercial electronic messages (CEMs), unsolicited bulk
emails (UBEs), unsolicited commercial emails (UCEs), or any similar unsolicited
mass communication of any kind.
