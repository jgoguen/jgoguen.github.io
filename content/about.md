I am a Canadian software developer and GNU/Linux system administrator currently
living in the United States and
employed as a Security Engineer with a strong track record of securing systems
I administer. In addition to my strong background in GNU/Linux and Information
Security, I am also familiar with [OpenBSD][openbsd] and macOS.

In all areas of my work, I have a strong preference for working according to
established standards and best practices. As a software developer, this means
standards-based and accessible code and output with security built in and
testing done before release. As a web-based software developer, this also means
providing out-of-the-box support for any modern standards-compliant browser and
for screen readers. Finally, as a system administrator, this means staying
up-to-date with software patches, monitoring system security and health,
ensuring that all changes are done according to established policies which have
been demonstrated to work, and ensuring any new solutions are developed with
both security and the end user experience as primary considerations and
thoroughly tested before being moved to a production environment.

When I'm not stuck in front of a computer screen, I enjoy reading High Fantasy
and Science Fiction novels. I'm generally not a fan of television but I'm always
happy to watch Doctor Who.
