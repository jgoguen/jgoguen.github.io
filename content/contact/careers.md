# Experience

## Meta
### Security Engineer

Time in role: March 2018 -- present

Working with the Client Platform Engineering team, I work to enhance the
security posture of corporate infrastructure and client devices. I work to
assess the security of core infrastructure, corporate services, and client
devices and recommend security improvements. I also assess new projects and
technologies to provide recommendations on their use cases and build tools and
automation to enhance the security of corporate assets. As part of this, I am
continuously staying up to date with the changing threat landscape and current
and new attack vectors and techniques, and I stay current on endpoint hardening
methods.

### Production Engineer

Time in role: June 2014 -- March 2018

Working within Security at Meta, I work closely with other teams to improve the
overall security of their systems while focusing on the efficiency, scalability,
stability, and reliability of their systems, all with minimal to no impact to
the people using their services. I also work closely with teams to evaluate the
tradeoffs of each decision from both a security and a user experience
perspective. By doing so I enabled teams to make clear, well-informed,
well-documented decisions about current and future work at every step.

Prior to working in Security, I worked with a team supporting the Meta Platform
(Facebook API, OpenGraph, recommendations, payments, social plugins, etc.). My
focus was on the security, stability, efficiency, scalability, and reliability
of payments services within a PCI- and SOX-compliant environment. I worked
closely with teams operating in this environment to ensure future plans would
retain our compliance status and to ensure teams were fully aware of the
possible paths through projects involving PCI- and SOX-compliant services.

## University of New Brunswick
### Developer / System Administrator

Time in role: May 2010 -- May 2014

I developed Perl and PHP applications and web pages to support the needs of the
university community, both stand-alone applications and applications developed
through the Hannon Hill Cascade Content Management System. As an essential
component of the development process, I worked closely with Business Analysts
and clients frequently during the development process and post-release.

I also managed CentOS GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows servers operating in
various roles within the university. I managed and integrated CAS, Shibboleth,
and Active Directory Federation Services Single Sign-On services. I also managed
Apache HTTP and Apache Tomcat servers.

## Q1Labs
### Software Developer

Time in role: April 2007 -- November 2008

I worked with the QRadar remote sensor development team to produce an automated
functional test suite for new and existing QRadar remote sensor devices. I also
located, investigated, and corrected defects with QRadar remote sensor devices.

I also created auto-update packages for QRadar. This involved correlating and
normalizing new exploit vulnerability information with existing event
categories. As part of this work, I developed a script to automate the retrieval
of new information and the generation of database update files for QRadar
auto-update packages, as well as the auto-update packages themselves after the
necessary components had been gathered and assembled.

# Before Reaching Out

If you are interested in considering me for a role at your company please be
aware that I am not actively seeking a new job, and I will only consider roles
allowing me to work 100% fully and permanently remotely within the United
States. I also have a standard set of questions I request that you be prepared
to answer before we schedule an initial exploratory conversation. Please also
ensure the subject line contains the word "cerulean" to show me you've read this
far.

- What is the name of your company and what industry are they in?
- What role(s) are you asking me to consider? Please include either a full job
  description or a link to a full job description.
- How diverse is your company, and the team I would be working with? Am I
  expecting to work with primarily other white males or can I expect to work
  with a diverse team and company leadership?
- What is your company's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion?
- What is the base cash compensation range for the position? If this range
  depends on my physical location, why does your company expect me to do equal
  work for less pay?
- What benefits other than stock, if any, does your company think are
  particularly noteworthy? Things like remote office setup stipends,
  professional development, or anything I might not expect to find at most
  other companies.
- Does your company commit to this role being permanently fully remote, with
  only occasional trips for in-person meetings?
- Does your company commit to strongly protecting employee work/life balance?
- Is your company's working schedule flexible or does your company require
  employees to work within certain hours?

I will commit to not sharing the answers with anyone, however I will ask that
answers be given before any exploratory call to save time for both of us.
I don't want to waste your valuable time with an unnecessary scheduled call.
