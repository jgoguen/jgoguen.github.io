# Summary

{{< include "../_includes/_about.md" >}}

For more detail, including my full work history and relevant experience, please
[download my r&eacute;sum&eacute;][cvpdf]. I have permanent work authorization
allowing me to work anywhere in the United States. In case physical location
matters, such as for various legal or tax purposes, I'm located in the State of
Georgia.

# Before Reaching Out

If you are interested in considering me for a role at your company please be
aware that I am only considering roles allowing me to work 100% fully and
permanently remotely without relocation. I have a standard set of questions
I request that you answer before an initial exploratory conversation. Please
also ensure the subject line of your message contains the word "avocado" to
show me you've read this far.

- What is the name of your company and what industry are they in?
- What role(s) are you asking me to consider? Please include either a full job
  description or a link to a full job description.
- What is the base cash compensation range for the position? Does this range
  change based on my physical location?
  + If the job posting allows hiring at multiple levels, please answer based on
    the lowest level I would be considered for.
- Does your company commit to this role being permanently fully remote, with
  only occasional trips for in-person meetings?
- Is your company's working schedule normally flexible or does your company
  require employees to work within certain hours?

I will commit to not sharing the answers with anyone upon request, however
I will ask that answers be given before any exploratory conversation to save
time for both of us. The reason I ask these questions up front is out of respect
for your time and energy. I don't want to waste your valuable time that could be
spent on other candidates, or waste your interviewers' time, discussing
a position I'm unable to consider.
