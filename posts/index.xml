 DNS Servers

&lt;p&gt;Your network&amp;rsquo;s DNS is delegated to two public Internet resolvers. I&amp;rsquo;ve used
Google Public DNS here purely to illustrate how to configure the DNS servers
used by your LAN, but you could easily use quad9 or Cloudflare or any other
public DNS service. Some people may have various privacy concerns with these
companies, or with any public DNS service, and some people may have more
extensive home networking needs that justify internal DNS servers (like running
a &lt;a href="https://jellyfin.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jellyfin media server&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>OpenBSD IPv6 Home Internet Gateway with AT&amp;T Fibre</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2024/07/20/openbsd-ipv6-home-internet-gateway-with-att-fibre/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2024/07/20/openbsd-ipv6-home-internet-gateway-with-att-fibre/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When you sign up for Internet service, one thing you&amp;rsquo;re going to get is a home
gateway. It&amp;rsquo;s going to offer wired and wireless Internet connections plus
a bunch of other things you may not want and probably won&amp;rsquo;t need. Unfortunately,
one of the things it&amp;rsquo;s going to offer you is poor performance. The wireless
network on it may not cover your whole house, and if you&amp;rsquo;re also limited in
where you can hook it up that could mean poor coverage in the most important
areas. It&amp;rsquo;s also not built on the best hardware for the job, so when it counts
the most you may not get the connection speeds you expect. Depending on your
needs, you may find that the ISP hardware doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer you enough flexibility.
And, perhaps most importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s not all that secure, and the firewalls can
be difficult to configure properly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>If you Understand TCP, you Understand Consent</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/12/12/if-you-understand-tcp-you-understand-consent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/12/12/if-you-understand-tcp-you-understand-consent/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you can understand TCP, you can understand consent. It&amp;rsquo;s really quite simple.
Here we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how TCP flags (the original six plus &lt;code&gt;ECE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CWR&lt;/code&gt;) map to
a conversation between two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to start talking to someone. In TCP, you start with the
three-way handshake:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#cdd6f4;background-color:#1e1e2e;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You --- SYN --&amp;gt; Them
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You &amp;lt;--SYN/ACK--- Them
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You --- ACK --&amp;gt; Them
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In human terms, a &lt;code&gt;SYN&lt;/code&gt; (synchronize) expresses that you&amp;rsquo;re asking to begin
a conversation, and an &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; (acknowledge) is how you acknowledge what the other
person has said. Note that both sides must explicitly begin the conversation and
both sides must acknowledge the other. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen like this, there is
no conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SSH Certificates</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/12/07/ssh-certificates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/12/07/ssh-certificates/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a SSH server, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard that you should be using SSH key
authentication instead of passwords. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of benefits to key
authentication: better experience, smooth login, ability to log in via scripts,
service accounts become possible, and keys are significantly harder to crack
than a password. But if you deal with a lot of servers, or you manage a lot of
users, or both, there&amp;rsquo;s a better way using SSH certificates instead of simple
keys.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>OpenBSD IPv6 Home Internet Gateway with Xfinity/Comcast</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/06/08/openbsd-ipv6-home-internet-gateway-with-xfinity/comcast/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/06/08/openbsd-ipv6-home-internet-gateway-with-xfinity/comcast/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When you sign up for Internet service, one thing you&amp;rsquo;re going to get is a home
