gateway. It&amp;rsquo;s going to offer wired and wireless Internet connections plus
a bunch of other things you may not want and probably won&amp;rsquo;t need. Unfortunately,
one of the things it&amp;rsquo;s going to offer you is poor performance. The wireless
network on it probably won&amp;rsquo;t cover your whole house, and if you&amp;rsquo;re also limited
in where you can hook it up that could mean poor coverage in the most important
areas. It&amp;rsquo;s also not built on the best hardware for the job, so when it counts
the most you may not get the connection speeds you expect. And, perhaps most
importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s not all that secure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
