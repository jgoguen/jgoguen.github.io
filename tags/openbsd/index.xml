It&amp;rsquo;s going to offer wired and wireless Internet connections plus a bunch of other things you may not want and probably won&amp;rsquo;t need. Unfortunately, one of the things it&amp;rsquo;s going to offer you is poor performance. The wireless network on it probably won&amp;rsquo;t cover your whole house, and if you&amp;rsquo;re also limited in where you can hook it up that could mean poor coverage in the most important areas.</description></item></channel></rss>
