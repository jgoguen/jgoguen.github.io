authentication instead of passwords. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of benefits to key
authentication: better experience, smooth login, ability to log in via scripts,
service accounts become possible, and keys are significantly harder to crack
than a password. But if you deal with a lot of servers, or you manage a lot of
users, or both, there&amp;rsquo;s a better way using SSH certificates instead of simple
keys.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
