It&amp;rsquo;s really quite simple. Here we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how TCP flags (the original six plus ECE and CWR) map to a conversation between two people.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to start talking to someone. In TCP, you start with the three-way handshake:
You --- SYN --&amp;gt; Them You &amp;lt;--SYN/ACK--- Them You --- ACK --&amp;gt; Them In human terms, a SYN (synchronize) expresses that you&amp;rsquo;re asking to begin a conversation, and an ACK (acknowledge) is how you acknowledge what the other person has said.</description></item></channel></rss>
