gateway. It&amp;rsquo;s going to offer wired and wireless Internet connections plus
a bunch of other things you may not want and probably won&amp;rsquo;t need. Unfortunately,
one of the things it&amp;rsquo;s going to offer you is poor performance. The wireless
network on it may not cover your whole house, and if you&amp;rsquo;re also limited in
where you can hook it up that could mean poor coverage in the most important
areas. It&amp;rsquo;s also not built on the best hardware for the job, so when it counts
the most you may not get the connection speeds you expect. Depending on your
needs, you may find that the ISP hardware doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer you enough flexibility.
And, perhaps most importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s not all that secure, and the firewalls can
be difficult to configure properly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OpenBSD IPv6 Home Internet Gateway with Xfinity/Comcast</title><link>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/06/08/openbsd-ipv6-home-internet-gateway-with-xfinity/comcast/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoguen.ca/posts/2022/06/08/openbsd-ipv6-home-internet-gateway-with-xfinity/comcast/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you sign up for Internet service, one thing you&amp;rsquo;re going to get is a home
