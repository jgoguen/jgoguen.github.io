I have a strong track record of effectively applying established standards and best practices to my work. I take pride in delivering high-quality results and consistently improving both back-end infrastructure and the end-user experience.
I live in the United States where I&amp;rsquo;m employed as a Security Engineer with Meta.
As a software developer, I am familiar with shell scripting, Python 3, and Golang.</description></item></channel></rss>
