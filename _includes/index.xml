CentOS and OpenBSD servers. I have a strong track record of effectively applying
established standards and best practices to my work. I take pride in delivering
high-quality results and consistently improving both back-end infrastructure and
the end-user experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I live in the United States where I&amp;rsquo;m employed as a Site Reliability Engineer with
MongoDB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a software developer, I am familiar with shell scripting, Python 3, and
Golang. I can also work with C, Java, or Perl, and I can learn new languages as
needed. Having a strong information security background allows me to identify
potential security vulnerabilities and help teams solve the overall security
issues they face in a consistent and reusable way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
