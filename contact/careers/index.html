<a class=heading-link href=#summary><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>I am an InfoSec generalist, software developer, and system administrator for
CentOS and OpenBSD servers. I have a strong track record of effectively applying
established standards and best practices to my work. I take pride in delivering
high-quality results and consistently improving both back-end infrastructure and
the end-user experience.</p><p>I live in the United States where I&rsquo;m employed as a Site Reliability Engineer with
MongoDB.</p><p>As a software developer, I am familiar with shell scripting, Python 3, and
Golang. I can also work with C, Java, or Perl, and I can learn new languages as
needed. Having a strong information security background allows me to identify
potential security vulnerabilities and help teams solve the overall security
issues they face in a consistent and reusable way.</p><p>Having a strong generalist background in both system administation and
information security helps to keep systems I manage updated with security
patches and configured to be hardened against common security issues. I am also
able to more easily work with subject-matter experts to develop plans that
enchance both security and the end-user experience.</p><p>For more detail, including my full work history and relevant experience, please
<a href=https://jgoguen.ca/docs/resume.pdf>download my résumé</a>. I have permanent work authorization
allowing me to work anywhere in the United States. In case physical location
matters, such as for various legal or tax purposes, I&rsquo;m located in the State of
Georgia.</p><h1 id=before-reaching-out>Before Reaching Out
<a class=heading-link href=#before-reaching-out><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>If you are interested in considering me for a role at your company please be
aware that I am only considering roles allowing me to work 100% fully and
permanently remotely without relocation. I have a standard set of questions
I request that you answer before an initial exploratory conversation. Please
also ensure the subject line of your message contains a pun starting with
&ldquo;orange you glad&rdquo; to show me you&rsquo;ve read this far.</p><ul><li>What is the name of your company and what industry are they in?</li><li>What role(s) are you asking me to consider? Please include either a full job
description or a link to a full job description.</li><li>What is the base cash compensation range for the position? Does this range
change based on my physical location?<ul><li>If the job posting allows hiring at multiple levels, please answer based on
the lowest level I would be considered for.</li></ul></li><li>Does your company commit to this role being permanently fully remote, with
only occasional trips for in-person meetings?</li><li>Is your company&rsquo;s working schedule normally flexible or does your company
require employees to work within certain hours?</li></ul><p>I will commit to not sharing the answers with anyone upon request, however
I will ask that answers be given before any exploratory conversation to save
time for both of us. The reason I ask these questions up front is out of respect
for your time and energy. I don&rsquo;t want to waste your valuable time that could be
spent on other candidates, or waste your interviewers&rsquo; time, discussing
a position I&rsquo;m unable to consider.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
